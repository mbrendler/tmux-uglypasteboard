Ugly Pasteboard
===============

This is a naive implementation to access the OS X pasteboard.  I use this to
patch Tmux, so it does automatically copy to OS X pasteboard.

Usage
-----

You need to download and extract the Tmux sources and run the following
command::

   $ ./tmux_patch_source.sh PATH_TO_TMUX_SOURCE

After that follow the build instructions displayed by the script.


TODO
----

 * support Linux
